The temple is dedicated to its namesake Siddheshwar, 
a twelfth-century devotee of Shiva who is considered 
a god in the Lingayat faith and the gramadevata of Solapur. 
It is at the temple's site where he is recorded as having attained 
samadhi, and as such the location is revered by devotees. 
Upon achieving samadhi in 1167AD, Siddeshwar attained samadhi 
and A marble samadhi exists at the centre of the temple today.
Siddheshwar is attributed to having installed 68 Shiva lingams 
in the main courtyard; the amrit (immortality) linga being one 
of them. There are several smaller temples within the complex, 
such as ones dedicated to Ganesha, Vithoba and Rukmini. 
Additionally, within the sanctum of the main temple complex there 
is an idolic effigy of Siddheshwar. A silver-plated figure of the mythological bull nandi is also present.
