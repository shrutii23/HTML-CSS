The Vithoba Temple, officially known as Shri Vitthal-Rukmini Mandir,
is a Hindu temple in Pandharpur, in the Indian state of Maharashtra.
It is the main centre of worship for Vithoba, a form of the god Vishnu or Krishna,
and his consort Rakhumai. The temple was built by King Vishnuvardhana of Hoysala 
Empire between 1108â€“1152 CE upon being convinced by the historical figure Pundalik. 
Also, there is an inscription in the temple, of a Hoysala King Vira Someshwara dating
back to 1237 CE, which grants the temple a village for its upkeep.It is the most 
visited temple in Maharashtra. The Warkaris start marching from their homes to the temple 
of Pandharpur in groups called Dindi (procession) to reach on Aashadhi Ekadashi and Kartiki Ekadashi.
